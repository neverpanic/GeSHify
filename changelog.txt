[[ 0.3.10 :: 12.10.2010 ]]
	» Added setting that calls set_header_type($type) to allow valid HTML output on suggestion of Sebastian Schuberth.
	  The default value is GESHI_HEADER_PRE_VALID, which differs from GeSHi's default of GESHI_HEADER_PRE (the latter produces invalid HTML).
	  If this breaks your CSS you might want to change this or update your CSS.
	» Fixed a bug that prevented using fancy (i.e. highlighted) line numbers.
